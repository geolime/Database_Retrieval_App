# Database_Retrieval_App
## Description
This is a Python and SQL based application created through the Python GUI package, Tkinter. 
The purpose of this app is to access data in an SQL environment for research or educational purposes. It was initially designed for real estate housing transactions where a user could define certain properties and narrow their search for specific data as well as retrieve specified attributes or statistics on the collected data. The data was based on Swedish real estate transactions so the specific nomenclature for some attributes will have the Swedish equivalent naming conventions.

It is setup to aquire two seperate databases in the root database directory where a user can choose which to query.
